# Feature-Enhanced Convolutional Attention for Unstable Rock Detection in Aerial Images
## RSUR-2D dataset
A collection of high-resolution remote sensing images, specifically features unstable rocks in Beijing's suburban karst terrains. Comprising 1,557 drone-captured images at 1300×800 resolution, it is split into 1,245 training and 312 validation samples, each meticulously annotated with multiple unstable rock objects. These annotations highlight key features like high protrusions and detachment from the parent mass, crucial for identifying potential geological hazards.
