We present the RSUR-2D dataset, a collection of high-resolution remote sensing images, specifically features unstable rocks in Beijing's suburban karst terrains. Comprising 1,557 drone-captured images at $1300\times 800$ resolution, it is split into 1,245 training and 312 validation samples, each meticulously annotated with multiple unstable rock objects, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig_dataset_visualization}. These annotations highlight key features like high protrusions and detachment from the parent mass, crucial for identifying potential geological hazards.
